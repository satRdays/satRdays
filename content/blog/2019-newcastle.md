In April this year, the first SatRday Newcastle event was held. In this post you will find:

- Things we learnt whilst planning the event.
- What we learnt from our feedback. 

# Learning on the go

## How to find speakers

We were lucky to get three excellent key note speakers, which I think really helps pull in attendees. Sometimes reaching out to big names can be a little daunting, so try and think of things you have in common, use communities such as R-Ladies or a Slack channel to reach out. 


## How to find sponsors

We were lucky to get three great sponsors, [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com), [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) and [Sage](https://www.sage.com).

I found with sponsors, if you don't ask you don't get so it's always worth chatting with local companies. It's also useful to look at who has sponsered similar events in the area, and reach out to see if they'll sponsor you too. Be clear about what you are offering them (banner space, logos on slides, a stall?) and the audience that you are likely to have. 

It's worth noting that [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com) gives a guaranteed ¬£100 sponsorship to all SatRdays conference. Just complete the [form on our website. ](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/q/satrdays/)

## Inclusivity

One of the attendees got in touch before the conference to say that she was planning on attending with her four month old baby and asked if there would be any nursing facilities at the conference. We were already planning on recording the conference talks, and were able to set up a second lecture theatre, streaming the talks from the main lecture theatre. This allowed the attendee to watch the talks from the privacy of nursing room when she needed. The feedback we recieved for this was really positive, and I would encorage future organisers to consider whether it is possible to provide similar facitlites at your event.

# Feedback from attendees

Shortly after the event, we sent a survery to attendees to collect feedback. We had a 45% response rate, which I think is pretty good. We asked attendees to answer questions on a scale of 1-7, where 1 was a strongly negative response 7 was strongly positive. Here's a quick plot of the general feedback.

As you can see, the response was overwhemingly positive. All attendees agreed that the conference was good value for money, and 70% said they were "Extremely likeley to recommend to a friend".

## Suggestions for improvement

Many people suggested the addition of hand-on workshops. As this was our first time running SatRday Newcastle we wanted to keep things simple, but this is certainly something we will consider for next year. 

The early start. We had 

More coffee! More biscuits! Pastries for breakfast!

We put on coffee breaks and a buffet lunch included as part of the day. We didn't collect dietry requirements in advance but the lunch had plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. A couple of people reaching out saying that their dietry requirements were not catered for and they had to miss out on some networking in order to pop out and buy lunch.

In order to keep the conference fees as low as possible, I don't think we can change much about the refreshments. I think the lesson here is to communicate clearly what will be on offer to set expectations in advance. Also, allowing people to select dietry requirements when they sign up will ensure they are better catered for. 

## Favourite things

We also asked attendees to tell us their favourite thing about the SatRday. A number of people said they really enjoyed the quality of our keynote speakers. Other people commented on the diversity and variety of talks.  Interestingly the most common comment was about the welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. They apprechiated the time to network and sound the ecvent comfortable and friendly, chilled, relaxed, comfortable.


# Closing remarks
We had so much fun at SatRday Newcastle 2019, that we've already started planning the next one!
