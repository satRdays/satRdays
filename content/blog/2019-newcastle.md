# Learning on the go

## How to find speakers

## How to promote the event

## Inclusivity

One of the attendees got in touch before the conference to say that she was planning on attending with her four month old baby and were there any nursing facilities at the conference.
We were already planning on recording the conference talks, and were able to set up a second lecture theatre, streaming the talks from the main lecture theatre. This allowed the attendee to watch talks from the privacy of nursing room when she needed. 

The feedback we recieved for this was really positive, and I would encorage future organisers to consider whether it is possible to provide similar facitlites at your event.

# Feedback from attendees

Shortly after the event, we sent a short survery to attendees to collect feedback.

## General feedback

Here's a quick plot of the general feedback. We asked attendees to answer the following questions from 1-7 where 7 was a strongly positive response ("Extrememly likely/useful) and 1 was strongly negative. ("Not atall likely/useful).


## Favourite things

Keynotes, variety of talks, atmosphere "friendly, chilled, relaxed, comfortable"

## Suggestions for improvement

Workshops/interactive sessions

Timings

Food - set expectations  labelling vegan (coeliac, vegetarian), communication
There were no provisions for dietary requirements (gluten free, lactose free) this is really frustrating when I've paid just as much as everyone else but I have to go and get my own lunch elsewhere - also meaning that I missed out on time chatting to other attendees. Put something in the registration form so that you can cater for these kinds of things. 
Collect special dietary info from participants 

Perhaps include an online crib sheet for those who are newer to the language, then have a symbol and a number on the presentation when there is a technical phrase/jargon so people can quickly understand what a particular thing is

# Closing remarks
We had so much fun at SatRday Newcastle 2019, that we've already started planning the next one! 
[SatRday Newcastle 2020](https://newcastle2020.satrdays.org) will be on April 4th. Hope to see you there!
