## Inclusivity

One of the attendees got in touch before the conference to say that she was planning on attending with her four month old baby and were there any nursing facilities at the conference.
We were already planning on recording the conference talks, and were able to set up a second lecture theatre, streaming the talks from the main lecture theatre. This allowed the attendee to watch talks from the privacy of nursing room when she needed. 

The feedback we recieved for this was really positive, and I would encorage future organisers to consider whether it is possible to provide similar facitlites at your event.
