## What are SatRdays? 

SatRdays are R-focused conferences that are held on Saturdays. They happen all over the globe and are organized by local community leaders to help and grow the local community. There is a big emphasis on making these events accessible – by not requiring time off work, by not costing more than a day’s wages, by being supportive of new community members or leaders.
